#### 1. filter by multi-condition

You can add  one or more filters from any data type or phenotype that we provide. 

- For **character** class, you can set "+" or "-" for retain or discard;

- For **numeric**  class, you can set ">" or "<" based on absolute values (min, max);

- For **numeric**  class, you can set "%>" or "%<" based on percentile values (0,1);

  

#### 2. filter by code type

You can also directly filter by code type.

It is important because we sometimes only want to analysis for tumor samples.



> By default, we will retain all samples under the cancer types and then consider the intersection space for above 2 operations.

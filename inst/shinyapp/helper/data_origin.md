Here, you can change the default data origin for **molecular profile** data type.

Up to now, we support DNA methylation and CNV data adjustment:


<br>
### 1. mRNA Expression
You can choose one of three normalization methods for mRNA expression data.

<br>

### 2. Transcript Expression

You can choose one of three normalization methods for transcript expression data.

<br>



#### 3. DNA methylation

- You can firstly choose the 450K or 27K array;

- Then,  steps (2)~(4) are used to specify custom CpG sites for one gene and how to calculate the overall value.

<br>

#### 7. Copy Number Variation

You can set whether to use thresholded (integer) data.
